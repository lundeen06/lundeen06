hello i'm lundeen! thanks for passing by. you can find my website [here](https://lundeen06.github.io/)

i'm a student at stanford studying engineering physics 🪐 and computer science 🖥️ - i have a load of interests, but recently i've found the most joy in space tech 🛰️, spatial computing 🥽, AI/ML 🤖, design ✨, and philosophy 💭

some things i'm building 🚀: 
* 🍽️ wafflr - working with [max huang](https://github.com/maxhuang8) (UChicago XC/TF '28) on an ai/ml campus dining app that enables student athletes and those with food restrictions to find healthy and safe meals, while providing universities real-time feedback to improve options and reduce waste
* 🛰️ samwise adcs sims - working with the stanford space initiative "attitude deterimination and control systems" (ADCS) team to develop a digital twin of our satellite to validate capibilities and later develop on-board software for our 2u CubeSat mission SAMWISE [[see repo]](https://github.com/stanford-ssi/samwise-adcs-sims)
* 🌈 HEIMDALL Protocol - a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that distributes cheap zero-knowledge compute for NASA competitions (e.g., Mars XR Challenge) while maintaining ITAR security compliance
* 🧲 prev: magnetorquer optimizer - design software that produces the highest-performance magnetorquer for ANY set of design and manufacturing constraints, automatically drawing the design into CAD software [[see repo]](https://github.com/lundeen06/magtorq-designer)
<!-- * 🍉 prev: mintdrop - a proof-of-concept platform streamlining NFT minting and dropping to demystify the space for regular users and suppress malicious actors -->
