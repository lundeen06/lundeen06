hello i'm lundeen! you can find my website [here](https://lundeen06.github.io/)

i'm a student at stanford studying engineering physics and computer science - i have loads of interests, but recently i've found the most joy working on space tech, xr, ai/ml, and design

some things i'm working on 🚀: 
* 🛰️ [samwise gnc flight code](https://github.com/stanford-ssi/samwise-adcs-flight) - developing and porting flight code for SSI's 2u CubeSat SAMWISE!
* 🛰️ prev: [samwise adcs simulations](https://github.com/stanford-ssi/samwise-adcs-sims) - developing a digital twin for SAMWISE as a part of the stanford space initiative's gnc team to validate adcs performance
* 🧲 prev: [magnetorquer optimizer](https://github.com/lundeen06/magtorq-designer) - satellite design optimization software that produces the highest-performance PCB magnetorquer for ANY set of design and manufacturing constraints, automatically drawing the generated design into CAD software
<!-- * 🥷 HEIMDALL Protocol [PRIVATE] - a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that distributes cheap zero-knowledge compute while maintaining ITAR compliance -->
<!-- * ⚡ prev: [xy magnetorquer analysis](https://github.com/lundeen06/xy-magnetorquer-analysis) - tested and characterized the XY magnetorquer boards for the stanford space initiative's 2u CubeSat SAMWISE, including designing & calibrating an [rm3100 magnetometer](https://github.com/lundeen06/rm3100-pico) to collect accurate magnetic field readings -->
<!-- * 🍉 prev: mintdrop - a proof-of-concept platform streamlining NFT minting and dropping to demystify the space for regular users and suppress malicious actors -->
