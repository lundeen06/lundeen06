hello i'm lundeen! you can find my website [here](https://lundeen06.github.io/)

i'm a student at stanford studying engineering physics and computer science - i have loads of interests, but recently i've found the most joy working on space tech, xr, ai/ml, and design

some things i'm working on 🚀: 
* 🛰️ [samwise gnc flight code](https://github.com/stanford-ssi/samwise-adcs-flight) - developing and porting flight code for SSI's 2u CubeSat SAMWISE!
* 🛰️ [samwise adcs simulations](https://github.com/stanford-ssi/samwise-adcs-sims) - developing a digital twin for SAMWISE as a part of the stanford space initiative's gnc team to validate adcs performance
* 🧲 prev: [magnetorquer optimizer](https://github.com/lundeen06/magtorq-designer) - satellite design optimization software that produces the highest-performance PCB magnetorquer for ANY set of design and manufacturing constraints, automatically drawing the generated design into CAD software
