hello i'm lundeen! you can find my website [here](https://lundeen06.github.io/)

i'm a student at stanford studying computer science and dabbling in aerospace - i have loads of interests, but recently i've found the most joy working with gnc, ai, satellites, and embedded stuff 

**main things i've been working on: 🛰️**
* 🛰️ [samwise adcs flight code](https://github.com/stanford-ssi/samwise-adcs-flight) - building an adcs system from the ground-up for a 2U cubesat named SAMWISE at the stanford student space initiative. all and structures are designed in-house. launches january 2025 at Vandenberg SFB, so so pumped
* 🛰️ [samwise adcs simulations](https://github.com/stanford-ssi/samwise-adcs-sims) - 6DOF attitude propagator designed to validate our adcs systems. SAMWISE's digital twin i suppose 🤩

**other small projects:**
* 🧲 [magnetorquer optimizer](https://github.com/lundeen06/magtorq-designer) - full-stack KiCAD design optimization software for PCB-based magnetorquers. we used this script to make SAMWISE's magnetorquers as powerful as possible given our set of design and manufacturing constraints. script takes in constraints and automatically draws the optimal design into KiCAD
* and odd jobs working with pcbs @ [samwise-avionics](https://github.com/stanford-ssi/samwise-avionics)...
<!--* 🧝 [thiel company name generator](https://github.com/lundeen06/thiel-generator) - ai-enabled CLI tool that when given a company idea, finds the name peter thiel would give it. uses recursive webscraping on the LOTR wiki, graph theory, and trie keyword matching to prune options and reduce the # of gpt5 calls while significantly improving the final output. classic 2am project-->
<!--* 🧭 [magcal](https://github.com/lundeen06/magcal) - a CLI-based magnetometer calibration tool. originally developed to calibrate SAMWISE's flight magnetometer-->
