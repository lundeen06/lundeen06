hello, i'm lundeen! 

i'm a student at stanford studying computer science and aerospace - i have loads of interests, but recently i've found the most joy in gnc, ai, satellites, and embedded stuff

**main things i've been working on: 🛰️**
* 🛰️ [samwise gnc flight code](https://github.com/stanford-ssi/samwise-adcs-flight) - building an attitude determination & control system from the ground-up for a 2U cubesat named SAMWISE at the stanford student space initiative. all PCBs and structures are designed in-house. launches january 2025 at Vandenberg SFB, so so pumped
* * 🛰️ [simwise](https://github.com/stanford-ssi/simwise) - 6DOF attitude propagator for satellite hardware-in-the-loop simulations

**other projects:**
* 🛰️ [samwise gnc simulations](https://github.com/stanford-ssi/samwise-adcs-sims) - 6DOF attitude propagator designed to validate our adcs systems. SAMWISE's digital twin i suppose 🤩
* 🦆 [when2notmeet](https://when2notmeet.com) - i got annoyed with having to fill out when i was available on when2meet [repo]((https://github.com/lundeen06/when2notmeet)
* 🧲 [magnetorquer optimizer](https://github.com/lundeen06/magtorq-designer) - full-stack KiCAD design optimization software for PCB-based magnetorquers. we used this script to make SAMWISE's magnetorquers as powerful as possible given our set of design and manufacturing constraints. script takes in constraints and automatically draws the optimal design into KiCAD
<!-- * and odd jobs working with pcbs @ [samwise-avionics](https://github.com/stanford-ssi/samwise-avionics)... -->
<!--* 🧝 [thiel company name generator](https://github.com/lundeen06/thiel-generator) - ai-enabled CLI tool that when given a company idea, finds the name peter thiel would give it. uses recursive webscraping on the LOTR wiki, graph theory, and trie keyword matching to prune options and reduce the # of gpt5 calls while significantly improving the final output. classic 2am project-->
<!--* 🧭 [magcal](https://github.com/lundeen06/magcal) - a CLI-based magnetometer calibration tool. originally developed to calibrate SAMWISE's flight magnetometer-->
